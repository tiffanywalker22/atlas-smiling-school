## Project Overview
In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap.
You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges
that you learned previously. You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to
implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple:
Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
